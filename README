OVERVIEW:
	

GETTING STARTED:
	1. Getting the Code - You can clone the DavisDSTAnalysis repository into
	   a directory of you choice by doing:
	   	     git clone https://chris_flores@bitbucket.org/chris_flores/davisdstanalysis.git
           Then, get the code of the submodules by doing:
	   	     git submodule init
		     git submodule update
	   If you are prompted for a password at any time during this process simply hit enter.
	   After this completes you will have all the code.

	2. Compile the Code - You can compile the code by changing directory into the 
	   davisdstanalysis directory and doing make like the following:
	   	     cd davisdstanalysis
		     make 
	   You should see output that suggests all the .cxx sources files are being compiled.
	   When this procedure is done you will have a new directory, bin/, continaing all of 
	   the compiled binaries.
